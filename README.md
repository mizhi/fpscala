# Introduction

This project contains my worked solutions to "Functional Programming in Scala"
by Paul Chiusana and RÃºnar
Bjarnason. (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

I don't believe these are the optimal solutions, but if you have kindly
suggestions for improvements, please let me know. In many cases, I've tried
multiple ways of implementing the same functionality. In general, I've split the
problems into a scala file containing the problem solution and a worksheet
demonstrating the validity. For shorter problems, I've put the solution directly
into the worksheet.
